# GUI-AD-Computer-Search-with-Powershell

Written in powershell by Jacob Keil / 2019

A simple GUI interface that allows you to search part of a computer name or the whole name to query the matching names in the current domain

Steps to search:

1. Type a part or whole computer name in search computer box at the top.
2. Press search button
3. The script should output the related computer names in the large read-only textbox at the bottom.

I am currently writing other search buttons for Users and groups.
